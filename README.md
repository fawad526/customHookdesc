# customHook
Custom Hook for API Integration:
A custom hook for API integration abstracts complex logic, such as data fetching, error handling, and caching, into a reusable, modular function that can be used across different components. This approach simplifies the structure of components by removing the need for redundant code and ensures that logic remains consistent and scalable.

Key Features of a Custom Hook with API Integration:
Encapsulation of Logic: The custom hook encapsulates API-related operations such as making requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), managing loading states, and handling success or error responses.

Reusability: By abstracting the API logic, the same custom hook can be reused in multiple components without duplicating code. This promotes DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles.

Separation of Concerns: Components focus on rendering the UI, while the hook handles fetching data, transforming responses, and managing state.

Improved Testability: Testing becomes easier, as the API logic is isolated within the hook, allowing you to mock API calls and test specific aspects of the hook without needing to test the entire component.

Performance Optimization: The hook can include features like caching to prevent unnecessary API requests when the same data is requested multiple times, thus optimizing performance.
