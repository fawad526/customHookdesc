# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# customHook
Custom Hook for API Integration:
A custom hook for API integration abstracts complex logic, such as data fetching, error handling, and caching, into a reusable, modular function that can be used across different components. This approach simplifies the structure of components by removing the need for redundant code and ensures that logic remains consistent and scalable.

Key Features of a Custom Hook with API Integration:
Encapsulation of Logic: The custom hook encapsulates API-related operations such as making requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), managing loading states, and handling success or error responses.

Reusability: By abstracting the API logic, the same custom hook can be reused in multiple components without duplicating code. This promotes DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles.

Separation of Concerns: Components focus on rendering the UI, while the hook handles fetching data, transforming responses, and managing state.

Improved Testability: Testing becomes easier, as the API logic is isolated within the hook, allowing you to mock API calls and test specific aspects of the hook without needing to test the entire component.

Performance Optimization: The hook can include features like caching to prevent unnecessary API requests when the same data is requested multiple times, thus optimizing performance.
